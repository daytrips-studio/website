        <a>Daytrips studio is an outcome of Covid 19 lockdown. The idea was imagined between two Iranian-Australian friends, Katayoun and Daryosh talking with each other in isolation during the first round of lockdown in Naarm-Melbourne. Daytrips gradually came to life in the second round of quarantine in 2020.
        <br>
        <br>In Daytrips Studio, we will be publishing our books created by our own photographs, images, and words in small limited editions. We will have seasonal postcards, printed photographs and eventually handmade apparels. We would also like to collaborate with local artists; friends in the near future.
        <br> 
        <br>Our books will usually have themes from our motherland <a class='iran'>Iran.</a> 
        <br>
        <br>Our Graphic designer Daryosh also takes commissions for designing and making our like-minded peers’ photobooks and catalogues.
